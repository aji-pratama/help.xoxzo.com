### Dial-In-Numbers API
Dial In Numbers (DIN) are local numbers (DID) which you can subscribe and receive calls with. 
By setting the parameter with any subscription of a DIN, 
you can either answer an incoming call with your specified .mp3 file, 
original message specified with our TTS,  
transfer the call to the other number as you like or
store messages in the Voicemail.

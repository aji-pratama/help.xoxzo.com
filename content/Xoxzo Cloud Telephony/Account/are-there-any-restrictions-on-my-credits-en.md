Yes, there are some restrictions on your credits which you should be aware of. We'll list them here.

Based on our TOS, your credits (including free credits) will be **valid for up to 90 days** from the day of purchase or acquiring those credits. Any credits which has passed it's validity period will be deleted and cannot be recovered. We will send you a notification email reminding you about expiring credits before they expire.

## Whole account view
Most of us use different API Users for different types of calls or messages or even customers. You can see at a glance the usage by the different API Users from the pie-chart in the dashboard.

## See individual API User's usage. 
Deep dive into specific API Users usage, by choosing them from the pulldown. By doing this, you'll be shown only the usage of that API User

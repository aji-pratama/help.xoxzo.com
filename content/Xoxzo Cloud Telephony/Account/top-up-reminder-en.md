It is no use to have insufficient credit amount in your account even the system is built
well to send out SMS and/or make calls.

Xoxzo can send you a top-up reminder. By setting a certain amount of credit, an email notification
will be sent to alert you the possible insufficient credit balance in your account.


### 1. Start the setting

### 3. Set the amount of credit

Type in the credit amount you wish to trigger the reminder.

Ex) If you want to receive an alert to be sent when the account balance comes 1,000 credits, 
please type _1000_. Please put an extra amount for this setting, as the notification email will be sent 
at 9AM (JST) daily, not the moment of credit balance gets to the limit.

Do not forget to click **SAVE** button to save this setting.

### Confirm your setting

"What was the credit amount I set to receive this reminder?"
Do not worry, please click the text _Enable Notification_ to check the set amount.

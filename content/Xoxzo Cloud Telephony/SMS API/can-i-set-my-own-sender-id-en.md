Yes, it is possible to set your own Sender ID via the *sender* parameter when sending using the API.

There are restrictions to the Sender ID though, so please read through this [FAQ](https://help.xoxzo.com/en/xoxzo-cloud-telephony/articles/what-does-sender-id-do/) too which explains what the Sender ID is in more detail.

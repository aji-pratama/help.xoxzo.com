##What is MVNO?

MVNO = Mobile Virtual Network Operator, they provide wireless communication services without having their own network infrastructure. They have a business agreement with MNO (Mobile Network Operator) for a bulk network access at wholesale rate.
They set their own retail prices on their wireless communication serives and may have own help centers as well.

##How does Xoxzo treat them?

While they are independent service providers, the basic rules of wireless communication itself would follow 
the original carrier, Xoxzo would mention on only the main MNOs that has thei own wireless communication base.

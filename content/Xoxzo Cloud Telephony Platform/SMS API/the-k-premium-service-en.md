## What is the K-Premium Service?

K-Premium is an optional service tailored for JP's KDDI subscribers. Due to the restrictions on the carrier, KDDI au subscribers cannot receive messages from alphanumeric sender ids Numeric sender ids can still be used, but the carrier is known to prepend it with unspecified numbers.

K-Premium allows you to specify specific numeric sender ids which will be shown as it is to the au subscriber. This will increase the user experience for your recipients, as they will know from whom the messages originated. If the number you specified is callable (i.e your customer support number) they can also call that number by pressing the call back button on their mobile.

You will need to be registered in order to use K-Premium, and to prevent abuse of the service your registration details will be shared with [KDDI Corporation](http://www.kddi.com/english/).

Due to restrictions by the carriers and also government regulations, these are some known restrictions that will affect messages/calls to JP (+81)

### SMS sending

- Sender ID for messages cannot specify numbers that will be considered as domestic numbers in JP (i.e numbers that starts with +81 or 0) to avoid number spoofing.

- KDDI (au) do not support alphanumeric Sender IDs.

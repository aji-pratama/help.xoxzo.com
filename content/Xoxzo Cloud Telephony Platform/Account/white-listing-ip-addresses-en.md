As an added security protection to avoid unauthorized use of your account, you can white list certain IP address to connect to your account via our API.

You can do this by adding the IP address, one per line in **Edit API User** page, which you can access by clicking on the Edit button of an API User in the Profile Page.

You can specify a block of IP addresses using the [CIDR format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classless_Inter-Domain_Routing), or a single IP address as it is. An example of how to insert the IP addresses are as below:

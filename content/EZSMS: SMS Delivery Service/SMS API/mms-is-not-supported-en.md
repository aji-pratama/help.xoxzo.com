##Does EZSMS support MMS messages?

No, EZSMS can send SMS but not MMS. 

###By the way, what is the difference between SMS and MMS?

**SMS**
- Send to a Mobile Phone Number
- Send only text messages
- As _SMS_ stands for "Short Messaging Service", there is a limited number of the text per message

**MMS**
- Send to an email address (of the mobile phone carriers)
- Send text messages as well as images and emoji
- Usually no limits on the message text length

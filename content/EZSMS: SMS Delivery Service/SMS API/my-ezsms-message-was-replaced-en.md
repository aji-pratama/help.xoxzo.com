After making an EZSMS account you will be given test points, which can be used for sending test SMS messages. However, please be aware that the content of this test message is set and you're therefore not able to send your own message. This means that even when you try to send your customized message, it will automatically be reverted to our Xoxzo default test message.

After purchasing points, you will be able to compose and customize your messages. If you still experience problems with your message being replaced by a default message after your purchase, please contact our helpdesk at support@ezsms.biz

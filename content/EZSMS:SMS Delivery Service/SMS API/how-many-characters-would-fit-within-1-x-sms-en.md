The [GSM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Short_Message_Service) standard specifies a maximum character length for each SMS message. These are ultimately determined by the carrier and the receiving mobile, but generally as a guideline

* A message body containing only ASCII characters can have up to 160 characters

* For the messages that contains even a single character other than the ASCII character set, such as Japanese kanji, the maximum length is 70 characters.
